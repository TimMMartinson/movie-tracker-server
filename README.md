## User Stories
---
#### MVP:
- As a user, I want to create an account.
- As a user, I want to sign in.
- As a user, I want to log out.
- As a user, I want secure authentication.
- As a user, I want to have a database of movies I have seen or want to see.
- As a user, I want to be able to organize movies by month of the year, because I want to be able to track what I have already watched, and add films I've yet to watch to the month I want to watch them.
- As a user, I want to be able to add and edit comments/reviews on movies.
- As a user, I want to track if I have watched a movie on my list yet, and update it once I have.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove movies from my database, because I may decide not to watch a movie on the list after all, or I may want to add it to a different month.
- As a user, I want a clean interface because I want to be able to see what I am doing.
---
#### Version 2:
- As a user, I want a better looking interface.
- As a user, I want to be able to rename my 'months of the year', because I want to be able to name a theme for the month (e.g "Horror Movie October" or "No Good November").

#### Version 3:
- As a user, I want access to a movie api to suggest films to watch, and to add them to my database
